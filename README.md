## Conclusion
Understanding the structure, source, and purpose of Amazon’s operational data provides the foundation for effective predictive analytics. By analyzing fulfillment, workforce, inventory, and cost data, Amazon can transition from static operational models to intelligent systems that forecast demand, allocate resources dynamically, and maintain service quality. The clarity gained during the data understanding phase will guide the next CRISP-DM stages of data preparation and modeling, ensuring that analytics implementation directly supports Amazon’s strategic objectives.
